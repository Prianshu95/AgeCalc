# AgeCalc
Python Age calculator project for beginners, it calculates the year and month of the user till today also tells the user on which day the user is born.
future development will include:
- All the functions present in the Mi Calculator.ðŸ¤”ðŸ”½
- integration with google calendar to add birthdays and other events

(ðŸ¤”ðŸ‘‰Because i bought a mi device and i really liked the app that's why i want to make my app to have all those functions and features.)
